# Vector Databases Applications with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository demonstrates six different applications using vector databases, with a focus on leveraging embeddings to enhance large language models (LLMs) and other AI-driven systems. These applications cover a range of use cases, from semantic search to anomaly detection, and showcase the versatility and power of vector databases in modern AI development.

## Introduction
Vector databases utilize embeddings to represent the semantic meaning of data, making it possible to gauge the similarity between vectors and efficiently navigate large datasets. In the context of LLMs, vector databases are widely used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, where models can access external knowledge sources, enhancing their responses.

This repository contains implementations of six diverse applications, all of which demonstrate how vector databases can be used to solve real-world problems with minimal coding.

## Applications Overview

### Semantic Search
**Objective**: Create a search tool that goes beyond keyword matching by focusing on the meaning of content.  
**Use Case**: Efficient text-based searches on a user Q/A dataset.  
**Details**: In this application, we will build a semantic search engine that retrieves answers based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches, providing more accurate and relevant results for user queries.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**Objective**: Enhance your LLM applications by incorporating external knowledge sources.  
**Use Case**: Answer questions using the Wikipedia dataset, enabling the model to access information it wasn't originally trained on.  
**Details**: This app retrieves relevant sections from Wikipedia articles to generate more informed answers for user queries, improving LLM capabilities by adding context outside of its training data.

### Recommender System
**Objective**: Develop a system that recommends topics based on user preferences.  
**Use Case**: Demonstrating a recommender system with a news article dataset.  
**Details**: This application combines semantic search and RAG techniques to suggest relevant articles based on a user's interests, allowing for personalized recommendations.

### Hybrid Search
**Objective**: Find items using both images and descriptive text.  
**Use Case**: An eCommerce dataset example.  
**Details**: In this hybrid search system, users can query using either images or text descriptions. The app uses vector embeddings to match and retrieve products based on the query type, enhancing the shopping experience.

### Facial Similarity
**Objective**: Compare facial features to determine likeness.  
**Use Case**: A facial recognition system using a database of public figures.  
**Details**: This application compares faces in an image to a database of known faces, determining the degree of similarity between them. It can be applied to various fields such as security, entertainment, and public figures analysis.

### Anomaly Detection
**Objective**: Identify unusual patterns in data.  
**Use Case**: Detect anomalies in network communication logs.  
**Details**: This application identifies deviations from normal behavior in network traffic, helping to spot potential security threats or issues within a system.
